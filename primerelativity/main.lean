  PRIME RELATIVITY: SPECTRAL ACTION FACTORIZATION FRAMEWORK
  
  This is the main entry point for the Prime Relativity project, which formalizes
  the spectral action factorization theorem and its generalizations from finite-
  dimensional matrices to infinite-dimensional operators and heat kernel asymptotics.
  
  **Project Overview:**
  The spectral action factorization theorem states that for commuting operators A and B:
    tr(exp(A âŠ— I + I âŠ— B)) = tr(exp(A)) * tr(exp(B))
  
  This project develops this result across multiple levels of abstraction:
  1. Finite-dimensional complex matrices (with full proofs)
  2. Finite-dimensional operators on inner product spaces (conceptual framework)
  3. Infinite-dimensional operators on Hilbert spaces (axiomatic framework)
  4. Heat kernel asymptotics and Seeley-DeWitt coefficients (axiomatic framework)
  5. Physics applications: extraction of GR and Yang-Mills coefficients
  
  **Completed Modules:**
  - PrimeRelativity.Basic: Core finite-dimensional matrix results with full proofs
  - PrimeRelativity.FiniteDimOps: Conceptual extension to finite-dimensional operators
  - PrimeRelativity.InfiniteHilbert: Axiomatic infinite-dimensional framework
  - PrimeRelativity.HeatKernel: Heat kernel asymptotics and Seeley-DeWitt coefficients
  - PrimeRelativity.PhysicsCoefficients: Extraction of physics coupling constants

  **MAIN RESULTS SUMMARY**
  
  This project establishes a complete framework for spectral action factorization
  theory, progressing from concrete finite-dimensional proofs to abstract axiomatic
  frameworks suitable for physics applications.
  
  **Key Theorems:**
  1. `PrimeRel.trace_exp_kronecker_sum`: Finite-dimensional matrix factorization
  2. `FiniteDimOps.trace_exp_tensor_sum`: Finite-dimensional operator factorization  
  3. `InfiniteHilbert.trace_factorization_main`: Infinite-dimensional factorization
  4. `HeatKernel.spectral_action_heat_kernel_connection`: Heat kernel to spectral action
  5. `PhysicsCoefficients.spectral_action_decomposition`: Physics coefficient extraction
  
  **Framework Design:**
  - Start with rigorous finite-dimensional proofs
  - Build conceptual bridges to operator theory
  - Introduce axiomatic frameworks for deep analytic results
  - Connect to physics via spectral action asymptotics
  - Plan for progressive replacement of axioms with proofs as mathlib develops
  
  **Applications:**
  - Noncommutative geometry and spectral triples
  - Standard Model + General Relativity from spectral action
  - Heat kernel asymptotics and Seeley-DeWitt coefficients
  - Renormalization group flow and coupling constant evolution
  - Beyond Standard Model physics predictions
