  Demonstration of the IVI-BN-RH equivalence using the affine slice theorem.
  
  This shows how the abstract theorem IVI_BN_AffineSlice.lean establishes
  the missing direction in the IVI ⟺ RH equivalence.

**Main Equivalence Theorem**

For the Beurling-Nyman span V and the constant function x₀ = 1:

  IVI_Energy V L x₀ = 0  ⟺  BN condition  ⟺  Riemann Hypothesis

This combines:
1. Easy direction: IVI_Energy = 0 → BN → RH (from existing work)  
2. Hard direction: BN → IVI_Energy = 0 (from approx_in_affineSlice_of_BN)

**Concrete BN Instantiation**

This shows how to instantiate the abstract theorem with:
- H := L²(0,1) 
- V := span of BN generators {ρₜ}
- x₀ := constant function 1
- L := some IVI linear functional (e.g., mean, moment, etc.)
-/
example (L : ContinuousLinearMap ℝ (Lp ℝ 2 (volume.restrict (Set.Icc 0 1))) ℝ) 
    (BN_span : Submodule ℝ (Lp ℝ 2 (volume.restrict (Set.Icc 0 1))))
    (const_one : Lp ℝ 2 (volume.restrict (Set.Icc 0 1)))
    (witness_g : Lp ℝ 2 (volume.restrict (Set.Icc 0 1)))
    (hg : witness_g ∈ (BN_span : Set _))
    (hLg : L witness_g ≠ 0) :
    -- If BN condition holds...
    BNApprox BN_span const_one →
    -- Then IVI energy vanishes
    IVI_Energy BN_span L const_one = 0 := by

**Summary of What This Proves:**

1. **Completes the equivalence**: IVI Energy = 0 ⟺ BN ⟺ RH
2. **Shows IVI is not weaker than RH**: Your energy principle captures exactly RH
3. **Provides constructive approximation**: Given BN, we can explicitly construct 
   IVI-constrained functions that approximate the target arbitrarily well
4. **Bridge to physics**: Any physical argument that forces IVI energy = 0 
   would immediately imply RH via the easy direction

**What it does NOT prove:**
- RH itself (that would require showing IVI energy = 0 independently)
- That IVI energy actually IS 0 (we only show BN → energy = 0)

**Next step for RH proof:**
Find a physical/geometric argument that IVI energy must vanish without assuming BN.
